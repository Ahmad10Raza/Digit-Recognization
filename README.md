# Digit-Recognization

## **Description:**
* **The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models for digit recognition. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a handwritten digit.**

* **To recognize digits using the MNIST dataset, we can use a variety of machine learning models. One common approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs work by learning to extract features from images. These features can then be used to classify the images into different categories.**

Here are some of the advantages of using the MNIST dataset for digit recognition:

* **The dataset is large and well-balanced:** This means that the dataset contains a large number of images of each digit, and the distribution of images is evenly spread across the different digits.
* **The dataset is clean and well-curated:** This means that the images in the dataset are of high quality and they have been carefully selected to be representative of the different digits.
* **The dataset is open source:** This means that it is freely available to anyone who wants to use it.
